# Code-Wars

##### Every day, you will be working with a new partner for whiteboarding. This will also be your partner for the paired lab.

##### Between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. each day, get together with your partner and read through the daily challenge. There are several items to accomplish, as time allows:

- Read through the challenge and make sure everyone understands what is being asked.
- Pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. You can each take turns in this process, or select one person to do all the writing, but each team member must participate in the discussion. Pseudocode can be described as writing out your plan in human-readable form. For example, `set up a counter` or `multiply each value by 2`.
- You should <b>not</b> be writing any actual code, only referencing Code Wars for the problem domain.
- <b>Take a picture</b> of your whiteboard pseudocode solution. Make sure each team member has a copy of the picture. This will be included in your personal repo and is part of the individual assignment requirements for full points.
- You may then continue to work with your partner or part ways to work independently. You should now move on to attempting to write the solution on Code Wars.
- You'll know your solution is correct when all of the tests pass and turn green. Only then can you add your solution to your repo.


##### The daily challenge will be posted at 5:00 p.m. every day and will be due by the following day at 1:59 p.m. Plan to focus on this task every day after class between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.

##### Friday assignments should be completed independently (or with classmates if you plan to meet up) over the weekend and submitted by 1:59 p.m. on Monday.
