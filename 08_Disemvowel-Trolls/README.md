###### Task
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

###### Examples
`"This website is for losers LOL!"` => `"Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!"`
